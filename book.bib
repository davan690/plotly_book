 abstract = {The shape parameter of a two-variable graph is the ratio of the horizontal and vertical distances spanned by the data. For at least 70 years this parameter has received much attention in writings on data display, because it is a critical factor on two-variable graphs that show how one variable depends on the other. But despite the attention, there has been little systematic study. In this article the shape parameter and its effect on the visual decoding of slope information are studied through historical, empirical, theoretical, and experimental investigations. These investigations lead to a method for choosing the shape that maximizes the accuracy of slope judgments.},

 abstract = {Trellis display is a framework for the visualization of data. Its most prominent aspect is an overall visual design, reminiscent of a garden trelliswork, in which panels are laid out into rows, columns, and pages. On each panel of the trellis, a subset of the data is graphed by a display method such as a scatterplot, curve plot, boxplot, 3-D wireframe, normal quantile plot, or dot plot. Each panel shows the relationship of certain variables conditional on the values of other variables. A number of display methods employed in the visual design of Trellis display enable it to succeed in uncovering the structure of data even when the structure is quite complicated. For example, Trellis display provides a powerful mechanism for understanding interactions in studies of how a response depends on explanatory variables. Three examples demonstrate this; in each case, we make important discoveries not appreciated in the original analyses. Several control methods are also essential to Trellis display. A control method is a technique for specifying information so that a display can be drawn. The control methods of Trellis display form a basic conceptual framework that can be used in designing software. We have demonstrated the viability of the control methods by implementing them in the S/S-PLUS system for graphics and data analysis, but they can be implemented in any software system with a basic capability for drawing graphs.},
